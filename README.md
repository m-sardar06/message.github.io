        <p> hi ahad. i just wanted to thank you for taking care of us so well. i could've done it myself but never as better as you did.
            isay sahi mei pata chalta hai k you are my shohr and i'm your begum. i can't live without you & i never get tired of you. ðŸ’•
            its a long journey ahead & will indeed be a beautiful one. not because of the things we have, but because of the things we can do. together! ðŸ’ª
            mujhe thora sa bura lagta raha hai k ap kaam sab chor k mere pass aajatay hain and i dont let you go ðŸ˜­ but then my conclusion was k time mila hai, we should make 
            the best of it. the more the memories the better. begum houn sab maaf hai hehe ðŸ˜‡ðŸ¥° i want you to know that i am here and i'm staying here. you dont ever need to worry my sweet boy, i love you so very much. 
            with lots of love & prayers for you
            mehr bano sardar &
        your begum </p>
